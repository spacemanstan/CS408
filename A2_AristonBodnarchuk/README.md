## Asignment Two - LIOM (Linear Interpolation and OBJ Models) Animation System

###### Video Demonstration 
to do...

###### Program Overview
Just getting my readme setup, I have spent too much trying to get obj and mtl files to export and texture properly. 

Very loose rough idea going into this is:
XML handler -> object handler -> animation 


###### Creative Features
 - Custom object based XML animation file syntax that promotes readability
 - Animation compile checking to prevent errors and notify user of missing files
 - Basic lighting!
 - Frame export setting to export animations frame by frame
 - Sound?
 - More, gotta read what the requirements even are lol
 - HSB colors
 - Color interpolation

###### ToDo 
- [x] Create readme files
- [ ] Start menu 
- [ ] HSB color support
- [ ] Color interpolation
- [ ] Design XML animation syntax
- [ ] Create test animations
- [ ] Export simple OBJ files for animation use
- [ ] Design XML reader that can parse and error check
- [ ] Design and create an object handler that can create timeline objects for the animation
- [ ] Design and create a timeline object system to manage anything on screen and delete when not needed
