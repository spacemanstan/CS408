## Asignment Four - Hierarchical Kinematic Models & Animation System

###### Video Demonstration

###### Program Overview
My model is built out of composite objects used to form a tree structure that holds a model, and all relevant positioning information as well as an array of children consisting of further composite objects. The model is displayed using the tree structure. By performing a depth first search I am able to stack transformations to play objects relevant to one another rather than relevant to the world. This model is then stored in a class called Boi as root, and global position on the screen as well as rotation are stored. This Boi class also handles setting positions, interpolating, or calculating dynamic dance animations as well as handling different global rotation modes. The main draw function acts as a driver for the boi class, which handles everything for the model. The mouse is used to interact with the instance of the boi class named Doug. 

An array of pose vector data types holds the data for the different poses used by the Boi class.

Rather than use keybindings I used mouse input instead as there are few controls needed and keyboard controls are annoying in my opinion. The mouse controls allow a quicker and easier way of checking all functionality works. 


###### User Instructions
 - Left Mouse Click	= 	Change Pose
 - Right Mouse Click	= 	Change Pose Mode (interpolate, set, vibe)
 - Interpolate ⇒ linearly interpolate to next pose on mouse click 
 - Set ⇒ assign to next pose on mouse click
 - Vibe ⇒ do a walk arm wave dance thing with dynamic animation
 - Middle Mouse Click	= 	Change Rotation Mode (face forward, circle spin, crazy spin)
 - Face Forward ⇒ No rotation, look straight / forward
 - Circle Spin ⇒ Spin in a circle slowly 
 - Crazy Spin ⇒ Spin in all directions simultaneously
