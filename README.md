#### Language (Processing)
Given the freedom to choose *any* language to complete the assignemnts I will be utilizing the java based language [processing](https://processing.org/). I have made many things in this language ranging from simple desktop applications to android live wallpapers and android games. The language is a sister project to arduino and very much intended for arts with a focus on visuals. I am familiar and quite fond of the language, and given how easy it is to install makes it my choice for the assignments. There is also a [javascript library](https://p5js.org/) for processing that would allow me to host the assignments on a webpage. My plan is to do the assignments in processing first and then translate them to p5js after if I have time. 

##### Installation
Head to the processing website's [download page](https://processing.org/download) and download the correct version for your operating system. Then simply just extract the zip file in your desired location and you are good to go with processing. ***Super Easy!***
